# SudokuSolver

Project from College.  
Solves a sudoku puzzle using 4 different algorithms with no guessing.  

## How it works

The puzzle must be written in a certain format and then pointed to in the code.  
A solution file may also be provided to show the solution.  

If all 4 algorithms can't find anymore parts the code will give up and display what it did figure out.

## Performance

Using puzzles from https://www.websudoku.com/ :  
Hard - Solved everytime  
Hell - Solved with a little bit of help (Filling out ~3 cells manually)
